## Portfolio Website Project

## Q1: HTML/CSS Question

Your task is to create a personal portfolio website using only HTML and CSS (one page). The website should showcase your skills and any relevant information you would like to include. The design and layout are as per the image below, but change the text and image to reflect your own information and make sure the website is responsive.

### Requirements:

#### Design:
- The design should follow the same structure, layout, fonts, and colors of the provided image.
  
#### HTML Structure:	
- Use semantic HTML elements to structure your web page, such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.

#### CSS Styling:
- Use CSS to style your web page.
- Use CSS variables to define colors [#D1884F, #008AAA, #3BBADB].
- Use the following font in the website: Poppins ([Poppins Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)).

#### Responsive Design:
- Webpage should be responsive and fit well on all screen sizes.

### Submission Guidelines:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub and upload your project files.
2. Deploy the website to GitHub Pages.
3. Share the GitHub repository link with us for evaluation.

**Note:** Evaluation will be conducted based on the above requirements and guidelines to assess your HTML and CSS skills. Do not use pre-built templates or frameworks like Bootstrap, ReactJS, etc. Write your code from scratch to showcase your abilities.

## Q2: JavaScript Question

Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns a number based on the following requirements.

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

### Constraints:
- `n === nums.length`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the numbers in `nums` are unique.

### Examples:

#### Example 1:
```javascript
const nums = [3, 0, 1];
// Your function should return 2 because it is the number missing from the range [0 - 3]
// Because 3 is the number of elements in the array. 
#### Example 2:
const nums = [9, 6, 4, 2, 3, 5, 7, 0, 1];
// Your function should return 8 because it is the number missing from the range [0 - 9]
// Because 9 is the number of elements in the array.
#### Example 3:
const nums = [0, 1];
// Your function should return 2 because it is the number missing from the range [0 - 2]
// Because 2 is the number of elements in the array.
```
